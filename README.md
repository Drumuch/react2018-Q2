# react course


## Module-1
Task 1 (Core concepts lecture)

Setting up the environment

Install and launch “blank” node.js application. You’ll need it in further development for implementing SSR. Commit this changes to repository.

Don’t use any generators (like create-react-app)

Create components in different ways, using:

* React.createElement

* React.Component

* React.PureComponent

* functional components

Note: To implement this task you could use React online sandbox, [optional] or start to configure basic project build from task 2. Share sandbox link with your mentor or commit to your repository
## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Drumuch/react2018-Q2.git

# Go inside the directory
cd react_2018_Q2_UA

# Install dependencies
yarn (or npm install)

# Start client server
yarn client (or npm run client)
```
